The learned do not lament for those who have departed life and those who have not departed life. || 2.11 ||
न त्वेवाहं जातु नासं न त्वं नेमे जनाधिपाः। न चैव न भविष्यामः सर्वे वयमतः परम्।  ~~  Never indeed at any time did I not exist, nor you, nor these kings; and never shall we all not exist hereafter. || 2.12 ||
देहिनोऽस्मिन्यथा देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा। तथा देहान्तरप्राप्तिर्धीरस्तत्र न मुह्यति।  ~~  Just as boyhood, youth, and old age come to the embodied soul in this body, so too is the attainment of another body; the wise man is not deluded by this. || 2.13 ||
मात्रास्पर्शास्तु कौन्तेय शीतोष्णसुखदुःखदाः। आगमापायिनोऽनित्यास्तांस्तितिक्षस्व भारत।  ~~  O son of Kunti! The touches with the matras cause feelings of cold and heat, pleasure and pain; they are of the nature of coming and going and are transient. Bear them, O Descendant of Bharata! || 2.14 ||
यं हि न व्यथयन्त्येते पुरुषं पुरुषर्षभ। समदुःखसुखं धीरं सोऽमृतत्वाय कल्पते।  ~~  O best among persons! That wise person becomes immortal, whom these situations do not trouble, and to whom pleasure and pain are equal. || 2.15 ||
नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सतः। उभयोरपि दृष्टोऽन्तस्त्वनयोस्तत्त्वदर्शिभिः।  ~~  Birth does not happen to what is non-existent, and destruction to what is existent; the finality of these two has been seen by the seers of reality. || 2.16 ||

स्वधर्ममपि चावेक्ष्य न विकम्पितुमर्हसि। धर्म्याद्धि युद्धाछ्रेयोऽन्यत्क्षत्रियस्य न विद्यते।  ~~  Further, considering your own duty, you should not waver. Indeed, for a Kshatriya there is no duty superior to fighting a righteous war. || 2.31 ||
